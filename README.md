# Fake News Detection Using NLP

## Project Summary

This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a model that can classify news articles as real or fake. The dataset consists of news articles, and the task is to apply various text preprocessing steps, followed by training a deep learning model to make predictions on whether a given news article is genuine or fabricated.

We utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are effective for sequential data like text. The process includes text cleaning, tokenization, padding, model building, and evaluation of model performance.

Key steps include:
- Importing and visualizing the dataset.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations like word clouds
- Cleaning the text data (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.).
- Tokenizing and padding the text data.
- Building an **LSTM-based** model to predict fake news.
- Evaluating model performance using various metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
